/**
 * Retail pricing derivation and the margin guard.
 *
 * Every catalog entry carries two faces: `cost`, the CNY we pay the provider,
 * and `retail`, the credits we charge. A model whose provider file does not
 * declare `retail` gets one derived here from its cost at the api type's
 * markup, so no model can reach billing without a retail price.
 */

/**
 * Retail markup over provider cost, by api type.
 *
 * Stated as a multiple of cost: 1.8 means a credit bought at face value sells
 * the work for 1.8x what the provider charges, which is a 44% gross margin —
 * the two are the same fact with different denominators, and confusing them
 * moves prices by a factor of two.
 *
 * This is the top of the ladder. Every plan discounts below it, so the entry
 * plan lands near +70% and the deepest yearly term near +30%. Raising these
 * does not by itself raise margin: a credit's face value and a plan's grant
 * are the same knob seen from two sides, so a markup change only means
 * something alongside the plan table in `subscription-plans.ts`. What the
 * markup alone does own is the price of buying credits outright, which is why
 * it has to sit above every plan rather than beside them.
